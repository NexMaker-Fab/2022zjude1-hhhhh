# 2.Design our first 3D model
+ ## Entity create 
Our group plans to present a musical toy with wooden structure at the end of the design engineering course, which needs a wooden locomotive model, so we directly take a small train as an example at this stage. 
>+ ## What to model? 
>>+ ### First, before the modeling, we did several research about train toys on the markets. 
>>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygen-berry/imageuploadservice/main/image/202210262334277.png) 
>>+ ### Second, we decide the approximate size of the little train through group discussing. 
>>+ ### Third, it's time make it by your own hands!   
>+ ## How to model?
>Due to the requirements for assembly and animation display of the homework after class, we have conducted some targeted supplementary learning on Fusion 360 through rich online tutorial resources.
>>+ ### Preparation
>>>+ #### Create a new folder for your team, and renamed it as your team name proudly(btw. we are team Peopl3 drag pe2son).
>>>+ #### New a drawing for you part.
>>>+ #### Save it, and name it, and you get it.  
>>+ ### Create sheets

>>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygen-berry/imageuploadservice/main/image/202211231723580.png)
>>+ ### Create entities from sheets

>>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygen-berry/imageuploadservice/main/image/202211231724774.png)  
>>Well, it's really disappointing that 3dsMax and other modeling softwares are not allowed in this class. Learning a new one in such a short time is a definitely a challenge for us.  
>>A Little MEME be like↓↓  
>>\- I want to use Fusion 360 for modeling.    
>>\- Just do it.  
>>\- But, I don't know how to use Fusion 360 for modeling.  
>>\- Just, do , ittttttttttttttttttt!!!  
>>(Well, then, long time has past...)  
>>(Congratulations for the warriors, at least, they finally succeeded.)

>+ ## TIPS
>In the process of learning Fusion 360, we found and mastered some tips for using the software.  
>>+ #### 1.Center: Double click the mouse wheel to quickly center your part to the center of the canvas.  
>>+ #### 2.Forward/backward: Press and hold the right key to scan left/right.
>>+ #### 3.Search: Press "S" and you can search for the function you want by name. 
>>+ #### 4.Select the surface occluded by the solid: Long press the left mouse button on the solid.  
>>+ #### 5.Switch color: Press "Shift" and "N" at the same time to quickly switch color discrimination between material color.   
+ ## Assemble

The most important part is the rotating shaft and wheels that make sure the little train runs properly. Luckily, we did it! 
+ ## Construct

This is the complete process of modeling and it works!
+ ## Check
Check model size, assembly relation and working effect

Trainhead drawing By using Fusion360, we can finish the drawing of the component conveniently.
>+ ## Step1. Project the desired view through the entity
>+ ## Step2. Make dimensioning
>+ ## Step3. Complete the description 
# 7.Other CAD software or using experience
CAD, fully called Management Software Computer Aided Design (MS-CAD), refers to the process of using computer software to design management software on the graphical development interface, designing the flow structure and data structure of management software, and finally generating independently applicable management software through automatic data loading and analysis of the computer software system. Here, we will briefly introduce two of common CAD software besides Fusion360.
>+ ## AutoCAD 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygen-berry/imageuploadservice/main/image/202211231728260.png)   
AutoCAD (Autodesk Computer Aided Design) is an automatic computer aided design software first developed by Autodesk (Autodesk) in 1982. It is used for two-dimensional drawing, detailed drawing, design documents and basic three-dimensional design. Now it has become a popular drawing tool in the world. AutoCAD has a good user interface, and you can perform various operations through interactive menus or command lines. Its multi document design environment enables non computer professionals to quickly learn to use it. In the process of continuous practice, we can better master its various application and development skills, so as to continuously improve the work efficiency. AutoCAD has a wide range of adaptability. It can run on microcomputers and workstations supported by various operating systems. AutoCAD software is an automatic computer aided design software produced by Autodesk, which can be used to draw two-dimensional drawings and basic three-dimensional design. Through it, you can automatically draw without knowing programming. Therefore, it is widely used in the world, and can be used in civil construction, decoration, industrial drawing, engineering drawing, electronic industry, clothing processing and other fields.
>+ ## SolidWorks
